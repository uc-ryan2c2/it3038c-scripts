This is the readme file for the password generator script.

The end goal of this script to be able to generate a password for an application that the user needs a password for.  This script will ask the user what applicaiton this is for, if the user wants special characters in the passward, if the user if they want another password, and then ask the user if they want to output the passwor to a encrypted text file.

To run the code just click run and follow the prompts.
The script will ask what application this is for so please type what applcation the password is for.\
If will then ask if you want special characters in the password or not since some websites/applications cant have special character or require special characters.
The script will then generate a password of 10 character length for the user.

Future goals:
I want the script to be able to tell if the user types in a incorrect input for if they want special characters or not
I want the script to ask the user if they want another password
amd then ask if the user wants to export the password to an encrypted file so they can store all there passwords in the same place.

Very future goals:
I want to maybe turn this into a prototype app for my self and maybe others
