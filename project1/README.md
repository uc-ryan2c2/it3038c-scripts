<h1>Password Generator<h1>

<h3>How to Run the Code<h3>
To run the code just click run and follow the prompts.
The script will ask what application this is for so please type what applcation the password is for.
It will then ask if you want special characters in the password or not since some websites/applications cant have special character or require special characters. Please type in 'y' or 'n' for this. If you try to type in a different character, you will get an error and the script will then ask you to type it in again.
The script will then generate a password of 10 character length for the user.


<h3>Future goals<h3>
I want the script to ask the user if they want another password
then ask if the user wants to export the password to an encrypted file so they can store all there passwords in the same place.
I want to maybe turn this into a prototype app for my self and maybe others
